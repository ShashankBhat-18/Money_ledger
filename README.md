# Money_ledger
We have created a program called the money ledger to help people manage
their finances in a more efficient manner. We have seen teens as well as
adults have major problems in tracking their expenditure as well as basic
finance management. Our program aims in helping people overcome their
difficulties with money. Our program is divided into 3 parts.

The money ledger helps you track the money you have borrowed and lent to
other people. It is able to add multiple records as well as update these

records.

A simple bill splitter which helps you and your friends in setlling bills at

various places such as restaurants, theatres etc.

There is an expense tracker which helps you in track your expenditure on
day-to-day activities/items and gives you a monthly report on your total
expenditure along with detailed description of where you have spent the

money on.
